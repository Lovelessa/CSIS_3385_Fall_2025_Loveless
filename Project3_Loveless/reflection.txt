The initial major change I made to the html file was the HTTP method DELETE which is not supported within the file type. Changing this to POST was fitting since the password form is making a request to check the credentials. Among other changes like the hidden password field as well as adding requirements for each field to follow to allow a successful submission. I chose the min and max length logic because it follows common webform standards. Not allowing the use of excessively long character fields as well as improbably number values in the age fields. While hiding the password from view can avoid detection from the average person using the webform it will not get past a bad actor that is attempting to gain illegitimate access to our systems. My making that field visible both makes it usable to the individual submitting the form but the addition of the password type allows it to be masked and treated as sensitive information.
